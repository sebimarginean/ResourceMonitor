# System Resource Monitoring Tool

This project provides a comprehensive toolset for monitoring various system resources such as CPU usage, memory usage, network bandwidth, and I/O operations. The tool is designed to run on Linux systems and leverages the `/proc/` directory to gather statistics. It includes a visualization component using GNUplot to plot resource usage over time.

## Features

- **CPU Monitoring**: Track CPU usage percentages over time.
- **Memory Monitoring**: Monitor the percentage of used memory.
- **Network Monitoring**: Measure bytes received and transmitted by the network interface.
- **I/O Monitoring**: Monitor disk read and write operations.
- **Graphical Visualization**: Real-time plotting of the monitored data using GNUplot.

## Requirements

- Linux OS with access to `/proc/` directory.
- GNUplot installed for generating the plots.
- C++11 standard compiler (e.g., GCC).

## Installation

1. Clone this repository or download the source code.
2. Ensure GNUplot is installed on your system. You can install it using your distributionâ€™s package manager. For example, on Ubuntu:
`sudo apt-get install gnuplot`
3. Compile the source code using a C++ compiler:

`g++ -std=c++11 -o system_monitor main.cpp`


## Usage

Run the program from the command line:

`./system_monitor [duration]`


- `duration`: Optional. Specify the monitoring duration in seconds. If not specified, the default is 60 seconds.

The program will output real-time graphs showing the usage of each resource. Each resource is plotted in a separate window.

## Example

To monitor system resources for 120 seconds:

`./system_monitor 120`


## Output

The tool will display real-time graphs for:

- CPU Usage (%)
- Memory Usage (%)
- Bandwidth Bytes Received
- Bandwidth Bytes Transmitted
- I/O Reads
- I/O Writes

Each metric is plotted in its corresponding GNUplot window.

## Limitations

- This tool is designed specifically for Linux systems and may not function on other operating systems.
- The network interface is hardcoded to `enp0s3`. Adjust the source code for different or multiple interfaces.
